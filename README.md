# COP-KMeans Clustering with Constraints

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of the COP-KMeans clustering algorithm with constraints. The project includes different scenarios and datasets to demonstrate the algorithm's functionality.

## Files
- `mahin1 (cop k means with small amount of people).py`: Implementation of COP-KMeans clustering with a small dataset of employees and constraints.
- `mahin2 (cop k means with complex environment).py`: Implementation of KMeans clustering with a more complex dataset of employees.
- `test2_random_cluster.py`: Implementation of a basic KMeans clustering algorithm with random clusters.
- `test2_random_cluster _cop_k_means.py`: Implementation of COP-KMeans clustering with random clusters and constraints.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```sh
